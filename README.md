# windows-debloat-and-optout
This is a collection of tool links and manual comands that can be copy-pasted to take a brand new Windows 11 install from full of bloatware and annoying configuration to something that feels a lot better and less creepy.

All system setups are unique to the user, and this collection is no different.  How I like my system setup will not be the same as you.  I've tried to point out sections of the commands that you should think twice before running, but there will always be things that are missed.

# Biggest Warning
Never uninstall the Windows Store appliication unless you're absolutely sure you NEVER want to use anyhting from Microsoft.  THIS INCLUDES XBOX Live, XBOX Game Pass, and ANY game or application that requires a Microsoft Account to run (like Minecraft).  

This guide avoids tools and commands that would do this very intentionally.

If you accidentaly ever remove the Windows Store App, it's very difficult to get back short of reinstalling Windows.
